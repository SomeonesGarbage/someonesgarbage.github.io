# The website is being rebuilt!
The website right now is kinda **bad**. It has:
1. Messy UX and UI
2. Messy code
3. Does not look good :(
4. Not responsive at all
5. Not interactive
The new website may break links and it will start with less features. But I will add more
*(The old website will still be avalible)
# contribution
